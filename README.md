🐱🐶 CNN Image Classification – Cats vs Dogs
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as Cats or Dogs. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, trained on a custom image dataset, and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

🎯 Objective

To develop and deploy a deep learning model capable of performing binary image classification with real-time prediction through a web interface.
